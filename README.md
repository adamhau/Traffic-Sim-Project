# Traffic-Sim-Project
A traffic light simulation final project I created in C++

THIS PROJECT USES THE SIMPLECPP GRAPHICS LIBRARY

Upon initial startup, you will see the graphics load in. The command prompt will then ask you for user input.

Input: on the command line enter a character

‘h’ : Heavy traffic density, will spawn 3 cars on EW and NS roads.
‘m’ : Medium traffic density, will spawn 2 cars on EW and NS roads.
‘l’ : Light traffic density, will spawn 1 car on EW and NS roads.
‘x’ : Exits the program without error.
Any other input will exit the program with an error message.

After entering a character, press the ENTER key and watch the simulation unfold! After all cars have moved across the screen and the lights are RED, you will be prompted to enter an INPUT. The program runs until told to stop.
